<p Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) for python users

This is a port of [Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_causal_modeling) for Python. The de facto reference implementation of DCM is part of a larger software suite called [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/), made by the Functional Imaging Laboratory (FIL), The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, in the Institute of Neurology at University College London (UCL), UK. SPM is written in MATLAB, and they kindly provide it for free under GPL2. They also provide a standalone compiled version of SPM, which doesn't require a MATLAB license to use. This version cannot be customized, however (except if re-compiled, which requires MATLAB anyway).

This implementation of DCM is based on code from SPM12, revision 7487.

It includes latest PDCM model (Havlicek et al. 2015) with an example of how to use it and S-DCM model (Friston et al., 2003).

This repository is a derivate of a [repository](https://github.com/tmdemelo/pydcm) designed by [Thiago Marques de Melo](https://github.com/tmdemelo) and thus contains the same license.
